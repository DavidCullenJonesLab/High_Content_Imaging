# High_Content_Imaging
A collection of toolsets for the analysis of immunofluorescent images.

'tools' contains the core functionality of my image processing pipeline, from reading and sorting images to outputting a csv containing all data in a tidy format.
'ktr' contains the functionality for measuring kinase translocation reporters. At the moment I've got this measuring just the green channel, to study CDK2 activity using DHB-mVenus.
'iteration' contains the functionality for performing iterative immunofluorescent imaging.
